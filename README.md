ðŸ“¦ @scaleleap/puppeteer
===================================

A Puppeteer convenience wrapper with stealth mode enabled by default.

---

## Download & Installation

```sh
$ npm i -s @scaleleap/puppeteer
```

## Usage

Exports everything the same as `puppeteer-core` package.

In addition to that, `launch` method is amended to include an `extra` option that can enable or
disable `puppeteer-extra` behavior.

Also `executablePath` is set, and `headless` is set via `PUPPETEER_HEADLESS` environment variable.

```ts
import { launch } from '@scaleleap/puppeteer'

const await browser = launch({
  extra: {
    // is true by default, but we are just showing the example
    stealth: true
  }
})

```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are available:

 * `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` - the location of the Puppeteer executable.
 * `GOOGLE_CHROME_BIN` - same as above, but only used inside Heroku buildpack.
 * `PUPPETEER_HEADLESS` - Whether or not it should run in headless mode. Default: `true`

## Heroku

For Heroku deployments, use a [`heroku/google-chrome` buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-google-chrome).

This package will get the Chrome locations from the environment variable provided by the buildpack.

```sh
## make sure we are using NodeJS
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs

## now add chrome buildpack
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/google-chrome
```
